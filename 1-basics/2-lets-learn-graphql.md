name: Let's Learn GraphQL
bulletPackage: free

At Kadira, we are pretty excited about GraphQL and we'll release our public API with GraphQL soon. We'll also open our performance monitoring tools and services for GraphQL apps.

This course is our way of contributing to the GraphQL community with some high quality learning experience. This course follows the same structure we used with BulletProof Meteor. It's used by more than 15000 developers to learn about building high performance Meteor apps.

## How is this course structured?

We introduce GraphQL to you step by step with one key topic at a time. Time to time we'll ask some question to verify what you've learned. You can also ask questions to clarify your doubts.

> You can skip these questions if you like. But, try to answer each of them, they are pretty easy. We also maintain a weekly leaderboard and you can win some prizes :)

## What Knowledge do I need to have?

We try to start with basics, so, you don't need to know anything about GraphQL. But, you need to have a sound knowledge in JavaScript and NodeJS. We'll also use ES2015 syntax and you can learn about it from here.

> We use NodeJS only when you are learning to write your own GraphQL Schemas. Even you don't have experience in NodeJS, you can follow those lessons. (Make sure you've NodeJS installed on your system)

For some lessons, you may need to clone a Git repo and do some tasks. So, we assume you've some prior experience with Git. If not, you can learn about Git from here.

## GraphQL Sandbox

In first few lessons, we'll work with the GraphQL query language. For that, we'll use an already define GraphQL schema. It's a schema of a typical Blog app. Here it is:

* Our blog has multiple posts.
* Each post has an owner and may have multiple comments.
* Each comment has an owner.
* Each comment may have multiple replies.

To intereact with this schema, you'll use our GraphQL Sandbox. It's based on an open source GraphQL editor called GraphiQL. It has built in support for documentation and autocompletion. You'll be using it throught out this course to verify what you've learned and complete tasks.

So, it's a good idea to watch following video to get familiarized with it.

## This will be fun

We try to keep every lesson short and sweet. So, you can complete whenever you've some FREE time. If you like any lesson, don't forget to share it and post a review.

Let's get started!
