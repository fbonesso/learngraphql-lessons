At [Kadira](https://kadira.io), we are pretty excited about GraphQL and we'll release our public API with GraphQL soon. We'll also open our [performance monitoring tools and services for GraphQL](https://kadira.io/graphql) apps.

This course is our way of contributing to the GraphQL community by providing a high-quality learning experience. This course follows the same structure that we used with [BulletProof Meteor](https://bulletproofmeteor.com/), which is used by more than 15000 developers to learn about building high-performance Meteor apps.

## How is this course structured?

We introduce GraphQL to you step by step by presenting key topics one by one. Occasionally we'll ask some questions to verify what you've learned. You can also ask questions to clarify any areas of uncertainty.

> You can skip these questions if you like. But try to answer each of them – they are pretty easy. We also maintain a weekly [leaderboard](https://learngraphql.com/leaderboard) whereby you can win some prizes :)

## What knowledge do I need to have?

We start with basics, so you don't need to know anything about GraphQL. However, you need to have a sound knowledge of JavaScript. We'll also use [ES2015](https://github.com/ericdouglas/ES6-Learning) syntax, which you can learn from [here](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features).

> We also use Node.js only when you are learning to write your own GraphQL schemas. Even if you don't have any experience in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), you can follow these lessons. (Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your system.)

For some lessons, you may need to clone a Git repository to perform some tasks. So, we assume you've some prior experience of using Git. If not, you can learn about Git here.

## GraphQL Sandbox

In the first few lessons, we'll work with the GraphQL query language. For that, we'll use an already defined GraphQL schema. It's a schema of a typical blog app. Here it is:

* Our blog has multiple posts.
* Each post has an owner and may have multiple comments.
* Each comment has an owner.
* Each comment may have multiple replies.

To interact with this schema, you'll use our [GraphQL Sandbox](https://sandbox.learngraphql.com/). It's based on an open-source GraphQL editor called [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql).” It has built-in support for documentation and autocompletion. You'll be using it throughout this course to verify what you've learned and to complete tasks.

So, it's a good idea to watch the following video in order that you can familiarise yourself with it.

## This will be fun

We have tried to keep every lesson short and sweet, so you can work on it whenever you have some free time. If you like any lesson, don't forget to share it and post a review.

Let's get started!
