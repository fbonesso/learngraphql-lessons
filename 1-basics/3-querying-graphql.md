In GraphQL querying is all about querying. In this lesson, we are going to start with how to query against a graphql server and get familiar with the graphql query syntax.

We'll be querying a set of blog posts and comments (as we decusssed earlier) via graphql. For now, don't worry about how the GraphQL server works and it's schema. Just focus on the query syntax and play with it.

At the end of the lesson, we'll have a good understanding of the GraphQL syntax. 

Let's get started!
